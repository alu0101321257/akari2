## Introduction

Utilized the model-view-controller design pattern with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle akari.

If you've never heard of akari before, I suggest starting by checking out [the akari Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle)).

## Running the application

This assignment uses Maven as a build manager, and JavaFX as a GUI library. Since JavaFX is an external library, it has to be included in the build process in order for the application to successfully run. JavaFX has already been added as a Maven dependency to the POM file.

To run the application with Maven in IntelliJ, follow these steps:

1. Click the vertical "Maven" expansion tab which is on the right side of the IntelliJ window.

2. Expand the "Plugins" folder.

3. Expand the "javafx" folder.

4. Double-click "javafx:run" to run the project.
